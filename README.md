# IT360 Forensics IOC Analysis Tool

## Overview
This project is a group effort for the IT 360 Forensics course, designed to analyze Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) using VirusTotal's API and OpenAI's GPT models. The tool provides a user-friendly PyQt5 GUI to scan file hashes, IP addresses, or URLs, delivering detailed threat reports and advanced AI-driven analysis.

## Features
- **VirusTotal Integration**: Queries VirusTotal API for real-time threat intelligence on files, IPs, and URLs.
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Leverages OpenAI's GPT models to summarize scan results with risk levels, threat indicators, and actionable insights.
- **Interactive GUI**: Built with PyQt5, offering a sleek interface to select scan types, input IOCs, and view reports.
- **Threat Classification**: Displays malicious detections, threat labels, and categories with color-coded verdicts (Safe, Suspicious, Dangerous).
- **Cost Estimation**: Estimates OpenAI API usage costs based on token counts for transparency.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Easily copy scan reports for sharing or documentation.

```

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/it360-forensics-ioc.git
   cd it360-forensics-ioc
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure API Keys**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root.
   - Add your VirusTotal and OpenAI API keys:
     ```
     VT_API_KEY=your_virustotal_api_key
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     ```
   - Obtain keys from:
     - [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/join-us)
     - [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

## Usage
1. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Using the GUI**:
   - Select a scan type (File Hash, IP Address, or URL).
   - Enter the IOC (e.g., a SHA256 hash, IP, or URL).
   - Enable "Advanced AI Analysis" for GPT-based insights (optional).
   - Click "Run Scan" to generate the report.
   - Use "Copy Report" to copy the output to your clipboard.

## Example Output
```
=== VirusTotal File Scan Report ===
--- Detection Summary ---
Malicious Detections: 8
[SUSPICIOUS] Medium Risk - Proceed with Caution!
--- Threat Classification ---
Suggested Threat Label: trojan
Popular Threat Names:
- Trojan.Win32.Agent (Detected 5 times)
- Mal/Generic-S (Detected 3 times)
VirusTotal Report Link: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/<hash>

=== Advanced AI Analysis ===
1. Risk Level: Medium
2. Primary Threat Indicators: Multiple heuristic detections and known threat label
3. Known Malware Patterns: Detected by 8 engines as a trojan variant
4. Confidence Score: 85%
5. One-Sentence Takeaway: Exercise caution; file shows signs of malicious behavior.
```

## Security Notes
- The `.env` file contains sensitive API keys and is excluded via `.gitignore`. Never commit this file.
- Handle scan results with care, as they may contain sensitive information.
- Ensure API keys are kept secure and not shared publicly.
